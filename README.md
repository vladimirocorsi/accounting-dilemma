# accounting-dilemma

The accounting-dilemma is a small project involving resolution the following problem: given a set of amounts and a single target amount, find, if any, a subset whose sum is equal to the target amount.
The approach used in this project is inspired by the subset sum problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem).

The solution is implemented as a simple Java project built with Maven.
